Hi, my love. Happy anniversary to us! ðŸ’– I wish I didnâ€™t have work today so I 
could be with you, but instead, I poured my heart into making this for you. 
Thank you for always staying by my side, for loving me even through my flaws. 
I know neither of us is perfect, and yet, every day you choose me â€” and thatâ€™s 
more than enough reason for me to choose you over and over again. Yes, there are 
arguments and misunderstandings â€” thatâ€™s normal, especially with how comfortable 
weâ€™ve grown with each other. But please know, Iâ€™m sorry for the mistakes Iâ€™ve made. 
Iâ€™m blessed to have you â€” someone who never leaves, who loves me whether I have 
everything or nothing. Mahal, thank you so much for being you. I love you deeply. 
I promise Iâ€™ll make it up to you once I get the job, but for now, let this be my little gift.  
Happy anniversary, my love. Hereâ€™s to more dates, laughter, food trips, silly fights, 
and endless memories together. You are my best, my enough, and my forever. 
Always take care of yourself, and remember â€” Iâ€™ll be here for you through thick and thin. 
Hereâ€™s to us, to our love, and to many, many more years together. ðŸ¥‚ðŸ’–
